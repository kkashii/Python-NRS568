# produce a small tool that takes advantage of arcpy and Python. You will need to provide example data, and the code
# should run on all PC's. The tool needs to manipulate a dataset across three different processes, for example,
# extracting, modifying and exporting data. The exact workflow is entirely up to yourself. You are expected to take
# 3-4 hours on this coding assignment, and you should deposit your code and example files within a Github repository
# for feedback and grading.
