# Introduction

## Professional

*Hello!* 

My name is Katarzyna Kos but I go by **Kasia**, 

that's pronounced _**Kasha**_. (It's Polish)

I am currently a grad student at URI going for my **Certrificate in GIS & Remote Sensing**. I completled my undergrad at _Salve Regina University_ in **Biology** with a concentration in **Environmnetal Science**. I also minored in both **Chemistry** and **Mathmatics**. Since graduation I have been doing all sorts of field work mostly in the _marine and aquatic_ direction. Unfortunaley these jobs are seasonal, temporary, and underpaid. _However,_ I noticed I was using different elements of GIS across all of these jobs and came to the conclusion that getting certified would increase my value as a professional as well as provide a sense of job security.

Here are some examples of GIS applcication throughout my past jobs:

Job | GIS Application
--- | ---------------
Aquatic Biologist | point intercept vegetation surveys, population trends
Field Crew | transect surveys, wetland dilineations
GIS Analyst | georeferencing and digitizing historic maps
COA Intern | watershed analysis

## Peronsal

When I'm not stressing about my future, I very much enjoy:
* being amongst the great outdoors
* traveling
* cooking
* a good ole film
* puzzles with a bottle of wine

I was actually _born in Poland_ and therefore I spent many summers visitng family back in the motherland and have caught quite a travel bug. There is just so much to learn and appreciate about differnt cultures in foreign places each with its own rich history. I would take a new adventure over material objects _anyday._ Cooking is a way I can connect with my culture as well as express my creativity. 

Here is a picture of me holding a Blue Jay when volunteered for a bird banding project:
