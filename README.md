# Introduction

*Hello!* My name is Katarzyna Kos but I go by **Kasia**, that's pronounced _**Kasia**_. I am currently a grad student at URI going for my **Certrificate in GIS & Remote Sensing**. I completled my undergrad at _Salve Regina University_ in **Biology** with a concentration in **Environmnetal Science**. I also minored in both **Chemistry** and **Mathmatics**. Since graduation I have been doing all sorts of field work mostly in the _marine and aquatic_ direction. Unfortunaley these jobs are seasonal, temporary, and underpaid.
